# Utils

This directory is for purely functional modules, like processing jsons or arranging the titlebars. Originally these files were in modules or libraries, but I use modules for the various settings menus and panels that are drawn on screen and library for other people's code I don't mess with at all, so I made this directory to handle the difference.
