These are the shell scripts useful to the configuration. While limited in number, and probably only due to my lack of knowledge as to how to implement their functionality in lua, these were written in BASH instead of Lua. Being that shell scripts can be run from within the configuration relatively easily, most if not all of the functionality you are looking to add into awesome could come from shell scripts but that would be relatively buggy and come with performance impacts I would assume.

Below is a description of the scripts.

| Script | Notes |
