# Project Log for 001 of awesome

- todo relates to changing the cursor theme on the desktop and over awesome in general
- added setting from link as specified, no change (may need to reboot)
- discovered xsettingsd not set, added to dependencies
- with `xsettingsd` and change to `Xresources`, theme is applied. Finally
- still not applied over terminal window
  - thus will reboot and hopefully the issue is solved
- applies over windows consistently now but requires awesome to restart to apply over awesome's windows
- added line to `.xinitrc`
- followed the second link tutorial
  - linked worked
    - added process to the installation script of my dotfiles to insure continuity after reinstall
  - tested for 2 days, mouse theme consistent (size is another thing, but easily mitigated and not worth the trouble at present to track down)
