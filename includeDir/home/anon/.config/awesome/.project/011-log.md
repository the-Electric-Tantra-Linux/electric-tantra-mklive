# Project Log for 011 of Awesome
**Task 011**: reconsider the arrangement and placement of the centers, all of them, condense what can be condensed, rearrange, etc.
- in lieu of 010, consider moving all the centers into a combined center
- doesn't work with all of them, however connections and bluetooth can be merged and have been, 
  - everything for bluetooth button is left in place and a note in comment form is there to remind me, indicate to others 

## Or Nevermind Its Happening Anyway
- moving all centers to control center anyway, there is much to be gained this way 
  - made possible by including the overflow widget layout that adds a scrollbar to the widget (useful for most of the widgets which produce long output due to populating an array with a loop like network, bluetooth and especially notifications) 

### Complete Rewrite of the Entire Control Panel
- so I spent a day rewriting and adjusting the entire control panel, utilizing a dashboard like model picked up from [rxyhn](https://github.com/rxyhn/AwesomeWM-Dotfiles), from whom I also borrowed the eventual solution to the reoccuring issue with the ram signal that seems fixed now. 
- also now included rubato into the modules section and will do more adjusting of its source code (as its not a submodule, for reasons explained elsewhere this config avoids using code not under my control entirely)
