# Project Log for 002 of awesome

- volume up and down produce null value errors, especially if the up or down keys are hit with rapidity OR after reaching full or no volume
- first place to look to fix them is the global keybindings
  - this did nothing, adding `value >= 0 and value <= 100` prevented the OSD from appearing at all
  - removing garbage collection from the connect in `signals` that the buttons are emiting to reduced CPU load and removed some of the issue
- in slider for control center, that is important for its possession on the vol connect function, the removal of several redundant and looping calls being removed increased responsiveness dramatically 
- seems to be solved for now, 
  - I ended up adding the ` value >= 0 and value <= 100` back into the key bindings 
  -  did some logic proofing with the signal
     -  more of this can be done as well, but it will need to wait I am tired of dealing with this for now 
  -  insured pamixer and its easier syntax are consistently used. 
  -  still need to fix the icons (issue 003)
