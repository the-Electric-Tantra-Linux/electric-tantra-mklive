# Configuration/Tags/layouts

Yes, these are custom layouts, which are inspired by the noted projects in each
file. Like much else about this configuration, I have preferred to take
ownership of the code so that I could

    a. format the files to my liking
    b. modify the code to best fit into this configuration
    c. stabilize and ease maintence

## Layouts

| Layout       | Characteristics                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| centermaster | center of the layout is most of the screen, additional windows on sides of the master client                     |
| empathy      | Three windows in a row and then the second row is populated, same for the next row                               |
| stack        | Two clients, with the master to the left and new windows stacking on the right (can be switched, check the code) |
| Thrizen      | Similar to empathy but the next row shrinks only the row above it                                                |
