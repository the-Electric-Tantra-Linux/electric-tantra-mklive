# Project: awesome

## Introduction

This index serves as the entry point to the .project notes and associated files. These subdirectories, intended to be replicated in the various projects I work on, are intended to help facilitate the taking of per-project notes that help to organize the work on the project and provide a location for to-do lists and project specific reminders that make more sense in my workflow than having project specific notes in my general `~/Notes` directory or a single file that serves as notes for all of my projects all smashed together and separated with some weak system of categorization requiring the use of specific tools to appreciate truly. This paradigm instead serves to keep notes where they are relevant, require no additional tooling than the markdown files themselves and provide a window into my thought processes as I work on a project.
