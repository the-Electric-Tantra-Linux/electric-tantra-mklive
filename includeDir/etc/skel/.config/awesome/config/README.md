# Config

This directory contains files that configure various builtin functionality of `awesomewm` such as client windows, the keybindings used across the configuration (both root and client) as well as houses the configuration files for the external GUI menu program `rofi` which I am working on eliminating the need for but as of yet haven't gotten my own menu to the point I would prefer it so `rofi` is retained for the time being.
