# Code Style

As you can deduce after glancing at any of this project's source code, it is written in a peculiar manner. Being uninterested in autogenerating documentation in a terse format, I have not written this source code to comply with the general AwesomeWM approach that provides specific sets of data in comments started first with a '@' character and generally ignored their pattern of module and widget composure as that ultimately adds more complexity and the general thought behind how I have written this code has been to minimuze complexity for myself, that I hope makes it less complex and more helpful to others because of.

The way I have pursued mitigating complexity is using a set of three (generally) comment bars to separate the various chunks of Lua code, preferring to isolate some functionality, generally a function, template or instance, At the end of these conceptually lumped units, I have tried to include a comment detailing what the section below it is doing and how that fits into the overall code. Below that I use a single line comment I leave empty to create some optical space that I find eases my interpretation of the snippet below.

Thus a typical unit may look something like this:

```lua
-- ------------------------------------------------- --
-- A function that functions

local Conjunction = wibox.widget{
    text="Conjunction, junction, what is your function?",
    fg="#e9efff",
    bg=beautiful.bg_normal
}
-- ------------------------------------------------- --
```

The point of this becomes clear in files made up of several functions that one may be nesting within each other, but which when allowed to bleed together become hard to understand and thus hard to maintain. I am personally not interested in spending much more time on this project, as such I have tried to consider my maintaining of the code as I have written it and wired it together (which I have tried to use glue and nails instead of duct tape and prayers to do).

## File Header Comments

Each file has been given an ASCII art title, which I have used my go-to ASCII font "chunky" for all of, as a means of identifying the file one is looking at without needing to use a code editor or well configured shell to deduce working on any of its files. Underneath this is a set of three comment bars, any necessary description of the code I felt compelled to include and then another set of three comment bars.

Thus a file header may appear as such:

```lua
--  __
-- |  |.--.--.---.-.
-- |  ||  |  |  _  |
-- |__||_____|___._|
--                    __
-- .-----.--.--.----.|  |--.-----.
-- |__ --|  |  |  __||    <|__ --|
-- |_____|_____|____||__|__|_____|
-- ------------------------------------------------- --
  -- This file will provide the conjunction function called by other
  -- files in the configuration, particularly other widgets.
-- ------------------------------------------------- --

```

## Comment Bars

The comment bars themselves are generated by a VSCode extension or copy-pasted from another piece of the configuration if I am using NVIM at that time (I go back and forth) that prepends Lua's comment notation (two dashes or `--`) to a line of hash symbols or `#`. The line generated is my personal soft wrapping point for comment text I am writing, as this appears much neater than one long string that on days my mouse decides not to work and need to use the track pad or keyboard to navigate, becomes extremely frustrating to read. When soft wrapped at the end of the **Comment Bars**, I constrain said comments to roughly what fits in half my screen and as such never have an issue relating to horizontal scroll (aka _reduces complexity_).

## Result

The result of taking a little more time both writing and understanding the portions of my code I am configuring my window manager with is that not only does it make it easier to comprehend what the code is doing anywhere in the code base you find yourself, but creates a more pleasant experience determining where to hunt for the sources of bugs that spring up, as well as generally foreshadowing the reason the bug is arising, which speeds up the process of locating and eliminating the bugs and ghosts in the shell that would otherwise plague a larger configuration (and is the issue with some of them you are probably familiar with). I have rewritten the entire project several times in pursuit of this state of moksha as I feel it is a valuable enough goal to quickly comprehend the code itself when using the configuration as a daily driver to achieve regular computing needs and being as thoroughly dissatisfied with the more traditional DEs that I might otherwise achieve as much with.

I do not reccomend this approach to everyone, for we all will mentally digest lua according to how it corresponds to our mental metamobilism and also think the way the AwesomeWM project comments its code is sufficient to achieve as much itself, in a way that is doubly useful to its devs no less, I just personally find this way works well for me and that I am the type that cares about the quality of my source code if for no other reason than the experience of wading through my own swamp trying to deduce what I was thinking and what my approach was when stopping up previous holes sprung in the dam with spaghetti lua (the only lua?).
