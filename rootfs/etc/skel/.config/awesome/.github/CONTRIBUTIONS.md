# Contribution Guide

If you decide to help, first of all thank you. Your efforts are greatly
appreciated and I am happy to have the assistance.

This guide will give you a description of how I format the work done here and
then log that work, which would be helpful if you followed as well as I will
otherwise spend time doing this myself if you do not (but in all but the most
fringe cases, I will definitely merge your work).

## Files Themselves

[Please Refer Here for More Information About Styling Individual Files](/.github/DOCS/STYLE.md)

## Changes

All changes get logged to the CHANGELOG, as I remember to log them at least,
which is found [here](/.github/CHANGELOG.md). No particular method of changelog
is being used and I am open to suggestions as at present it is freeform notes
categorized into the following topics that are somewhat self-explanatory:
`ADDED`, `CHANGED`, `REMOVED` & `FIXED` with a final `NOTES` section where I
remind/inform my future self of the context and things I have tried but didn't
work out (which eats a lot of time sometimes as you probably can imagine)

## Comparison to AwesomeWM Contributions

Unlike Tom Meyers' work,
[available here for reference](https://github.com/ODEX-TOS/tos-desktop-environment/),
I do not institute the same form of source code or documentation as the project that
this project configures. There are manifold reasons here, detailed below, though
I will first make a point of illuminating **that in the context of the window
manager itself, I think this method is highly functional and amazingly
efficient** and that **I have no problem whatsoever with that methodology but
just prefer doing my own thing for my ease of understanding the code
later**. `AwesomeWM` is a C+Lua project spread over numerous files and
maintained by numerous individuals. This project is a Lua (mostly) configuration
of `awesomewm` spread over numerous files but maintained solely by me, Thomas
Leon Highbaugh, thus there are radically different developmental pressures on it, hence me
eschewing the replication of the source projects comments or replication of its
documentation.

**Rationale for Not Using `AwesomeWM`'s Documentation/Commentary Style**

- **Different Consumption Patterns** - I am not writing modules intended for
  consumption via a window manager API, thus I need not separate out the
  parameters I am making available to potential users. Instead modules made
  locally are consumed locally, which I hope others find helpful and am even
  willing to help them adapt into their own configurations but not intended to
  be used the same way.
- **Goals** - My commentary is intended to make _it easier for me to read the
  code in a few months_, not generate documentation. Therefore it makes imposing
  the source project's commentary style on my writing onerous without obvious
  benefit. Meyers' work intends to achieve a more similar goal to the original
  project, for instance, so this is different for him. I totally get that, wish
  him the best in the process and deeply appreciate his work (in particular) but
  simply do not share that goal as well.
- **Documentation Readability** - While bombastic and at times alliterative in my use of prose, my writing is somewhat more thorough and easy to understand than the majority of pages that are the result of awesome's method of auto-generating the code. Sometimes, this makes pages hard/impossible to read or pull relevant information from. Since this entire project is mine, I can easily type out a few pages of documentation

## Code of Conduct

I am not a babysitter, nor am I primary school teacher, both for good reasons.
While I refuse to adopt any heavy-handed hard-boiled ethical code for
contributing to this project or organization in general, I nonetheless will not
tolerate and will block anyone using this project to act unprofessionally _as I
deem it so_, being an average reasonable person with a thorough and fair set of
notions of what _unprofessional_ is and what it looks like when people are such.

If I must adopt a firm set of legal hyperbole for this purpose, I will, but
until then let this serve as an informal indictation of how unwilling I am to
deal with as much before I search out and institute a draconian set of artifical
ethics.
