This is originally the work of the authors of the awesome-freedesktop project, Harvey Mittens and Luke Bonham, you are probably fully aware of and the license included with that software is available in this same directory for your reference. This is a modified derivative intended to fit it into this particular code base, but is largely unaltered in any substantial way thus the inclusion fot the license. 

A big thank you and special shout out to Harvey and Luke for their efforts.
