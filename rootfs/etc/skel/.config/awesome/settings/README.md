# Settings 

This directory houses the settings file, containing variables easily modified for configuration adjustment specific to a user's tastes or my needs on various hardware or when switching various system underpinnings. It also contains the frustration saving global variables file that takes care of the importation of various libraries and modules all at once and is called early in the `rc.lua` file as well as the memory saving garbage collection file that sets the built in lua garbage collector. 

This is a tale of two directories in a sense, as its files make it both harder in some sense and easier in another for interested third parties to port pieces of the configuration externally to their own configuration (which is welcome, if not encouraged). It is easier in that the variables defined in the directory's `init.lua` should mean various adjustments become easier to handle when modules or widgets are taken from this configuration and added to another but harder in that the `global_variables` file strips out library calls from individual files and instead contains them for the entire configuration (making my life much easier writing much of this out and not running into errors because I forgot to call one or another library).
