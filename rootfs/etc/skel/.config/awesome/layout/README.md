# Layout 

Here we assign the tiling layouts to the tags, calling on custom layouts found in the `layouts` subdirectory (for want of a better name). The available custom layouts provided by the `layouts` subdirectory are listed in a table below with a brief explanation of the pattern they arrange the client windows in. 

| Layout       | Arrangement                                                      |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| centermaster | master in the center and additional on the sides                 |
| empathy      | Stacks three on top, two on bottom                               |
| stack        | splits window in half and stacks additional windows on the right |
| thrizen      | three column layout                                              |
