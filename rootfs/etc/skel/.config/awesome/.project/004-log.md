# Project Log for 004

- Task is converting the color hexs to the colors.[whatever_color] format that is present in the theme file and should now have totally replaced hex codes
  -  purpose is to make it easier to theme later, both for myself when I tire of the GTK theme and others who may use this configuration as a basis 
  - also makes transparency a separate call, the added abstraction helps isolate this from the color itself a bit and thus easier to contend with mentally.
-  the search function pulled up nothing with "# so I have instead opted to first look for gradients and then afterwards manually scanning for hex codes
- should be finished, no major incidents and if additional hex codes are found, they are easily switched.
